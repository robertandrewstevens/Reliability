## Typical Infant Mortality Failures

  - Substandard workmanship

  - Poor quality control

  - Substandard materials

  - Insufficient debugging

  - Poor manufacturing techniques

  - Poor process or handling techniques

  - Problems due to assembly

  - Contamination

  - Improper installation

  - Improper start-up

  - Human error

  - Parts failure in storage or transit

  - Improper packaging or transportation practices

## Typical Random Failures

  - Low safety factors

  - Stress related failures - higher than expected random loads

  - Lower random strength than expected

  - Defects which cannot be detected by the “best” available inspection
    techniques

  - Abuse

  - Human errors

  - Failures that cannot be observed during debugging

  - Failures that cannot be prevented by the “best” preventive
    maintenance practices

  - Unexplainable cause

  - “Act of God” failures

## Typical Wearout Failures

  - Degradation

  - Wear

  - Aging

  - Fatigue

  - Creep

  - Poor maintenance and service

  - Improper overhaul practice

  - Short designed-in life
