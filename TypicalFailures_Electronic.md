## Typical Infant Mortality Failures

  - General
      - No solder or solder shorts
      - Damage accrued during repair (e.g. broken leads)
      - Incorrect parts placed onto the PWB
      - Coplanarity problems with surface mount technology (SMT) parts
  - Thermal Cycling Induced
      - Component parameter drift
      - Circuit board opens/shorts
      - Component incorrectly installed
      - Wrong component
      - Hermetic seal failure
      - Chemical contamination
      - Defective harness termination
      - Improper crimp
      - Poor bonding
      - Cracked components
  - Vibration Induced
      - Particle contamination
      - Chafed/pinched wires
      - Defective crystals
      - Component mounting problems
      - Adjacent boards rubbing
      - Components shorting
      - Loose wires
      - Poorly bonded components
      - Inadequately secured high mass parts
      - Mechanical flaws
  - Thermal or Vibration Induced
      - Defective solder joints
      - Loose hardware
      - Defective components
      - Loose fasteners
      - Broken component
      - Circuit board etch defective

## Typical Random Failures

  - Thermal management issues (e.g. inadequately sized heat sinks for
    power transistors)

  - Timing margin problems

  - Material coefficient of expansion (CTE) mismatch (e.g. between
    ceramic and copper)

## Typical Wearout Failures

  - Bond wire or ball bond

  - Cracked die

  - Oscillator crystal flaws or attachment errors

  - Printed wiring board (PWB) defects (e.g. cracked vias, defective
    solder mask)
